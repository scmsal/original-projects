Although I have completed a number of projects as coursework or as extensions of coursework, I am creating this project from scratch. The aim is to practice using React, Redux, Bootstrap, and APIs. I extensively used ChatGPT as a mentor and pair-programmer to help me implement my ideas, be more incisive in my debugging, and answer my questions regarding concepts and best practices.

Update: I might need to rework this to avoid persistant data storage from the API.
