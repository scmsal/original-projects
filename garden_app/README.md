Although I have completed a number of projects as coursework or as extensions of coursework, I am creating this project from scratch. The aim is to practice using React, Redux, Bootstrap, and APIs. I extensively used ChatGPT as a mentor and pair-programmer to help me implement my ideas, be more incisive in my debugging, and answer my questions regarding concepts and best practices.

Update end of April 2025:  I might need to rework this to avoid persistant data storage from the API.

Update 5/21/25: To overcome the limitations of database APIs, I am currently working on accessing the open source database from https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm that was archived on April 22, 2025. The application is in Ruby (which I've never used before) and I've had to rework it to run on a Mac with Apple Silicone, with guidance from ChatGPT.
