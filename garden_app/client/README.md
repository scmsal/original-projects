Although I have completed a number of projects as coursework or as extensions of coursework, I am creating this project from scratch. The aim is to practice using React, Redux, Bootstrap, and APIs. I extensively used ChatGPT as a mentor and pair-programmer to help me implement my ideas, be more incisive in my debugging, and answer my questions regarding concepts and best practices.

Update end of April 2025: I might need to rework this to avoid persistant data storage from the API.

Updates 5/21/25:

- To overcome the limitations of database APIs, I spent time accessing the open source database from https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm that was archived on April 22, 2025. The application is in Ruby (which I've never used before) and I've had to update and rework it to run on a Mac with Apple Silicone, with guidance from ChatGPT.
- Unfortunately, it turned out to only contain essentially a list of plants' common and scientific names. I'll have to find another solution for data for my project. Nonetheless, I did get to experience working with Docker, MongoDB shell, and MongoDB Compass, as well as being introduced to Ruby on Rails and Vagrant. You can see my fork at https://github.com/scmsal/OpenFarm.
- I provided AI (Gemini) with an object structure and a list of plants. It produced a json file sourced from "general gardening knowledge", that can be the starting point for building my own small database for this project.
